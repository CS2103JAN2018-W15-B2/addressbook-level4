== Setting up
This section details how one can go about setting up IMDB.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Getting started with coding

You are now ready to start coding. You may wish to refer to the links below for more information.

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

{empty} +
The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for the following:

* At app launch: It initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: It shuts down the components and invokes the cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of the following components:

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.
{empty} +
{empty} +

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
{empty} +

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

{empty} +

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
{empty} +

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th patient in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new patient.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::remark[]
=== Edit remarks feature
==== Current Implementation

The edit remarks mechanism is facilitated by a `RemarkCommand`.
It supports editing the remarks of a `Patient` to match the user input. `RemarkCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand` as well.

The edit remarks mechanism functions like that of the `Edit`. It searches for the patient to be edited based on the index provided
by the user. It then creates a new patient with the same attributes as the patient to be edited, changing the remarks attribute to
match the user input. The `RemarkCommand` then calls for the utility method updatePerson under `Model`, to replace the patient to be
edited with the edited patient.

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The current list is shown in Figure 3.2.1.1. below.

image::Figure 3.2.1.1.PNG[width="800"]

The user now decides to edit the remarks of the first person in the list.

`RemarkCommand` will search for the first person in the list and store it as the person to be edited as shown in Figure 3.2.1.2. below.
`RemarkCommand` will then create a new patient with the same attributes as the patient to be edited, except the remarks attribute
which will be based on the user input. This new patient will be stored as the edited patient as shown in Figure 3.2.1.2. below.

image::Figure 3.2.1.2.PNG[width="800"]

`RemarkCommand` will finally call the for the utility method updatePerson under `Model`, to replace the patient to be edited with the edited patient,
the new list will be as shown in Figure 3.2.1.2. below.

image::Figure 3.2.1.3.PNG[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

The following is an exploration of possible alternative implementations, the various aspects of
each implementation and the pros and cons of each implementation:

===== Aspect: Implementation of `RemarkCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a duplicate `Patient` and utilise updatePerson to edit the remarks
** Pros: Will be easy to implement due to existing utility methods.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a public method in `Remark` for updating the remark which will be called by `Patient`
** Pros: Will use less memory (no need to create new patient object).
** Cons: Will require public access to `Remark` stored in `Patient` (possible security concerns).

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the remark command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `Remark` that is stored in `Patient`
** Pros: Will be easy to understand for new developers as it follows existing structures.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a String that is stored in `Patient`
** Pros: Will use less memory (no need to create new remark object).
** Cons: Will require a method in Patient to update and verify validity of remark. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `Patient` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::remark[]

// tag::morefields[]
=== Implement NRIC, DOB and Blood Type detail fields
==== Current Implementation

The additional fields added is managed by the `AddCommand` and the `EditCommand`.
They are included as fields to be filled in when adding a new `Patient` or when editing an existing `Patient`.

Both `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` have been modified to accept new inputs corresponding with the new fields implemented.

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The current list is shown in Figure 3.3.1.1. below.

.The current queue
image::Figure3-3-1-1.png[width="800"]

The user now decides to edit the blood type of the first person in the list (he got a blood transfusion).

`EditCommand` will search for the first person in the list and store it as the person to be edited as shown in Figure 3.3.1.2. below.
`EditCommand` will then create a new patient with the same attributes as the patient to be edited, except the remarks attribute
which will be based on the user input. This new patient will be stored as the edited patient as shown in Figure 3.3.1.2. below.

.The patient before and after editing
image::Figure3-3-1-2.png[width="800"]

`EditCommand` will finally call the for the utility method updatePerson under `Model`, to replace the patient to be edited with the edited patient,
the new list will be as shown in Figure 3.3.1.2. below.

.The queue with updated details
image::Figure3-3-1-3.png[width="650"]
// end::morefields[]

// tag::addqremoveq[]
=== Patient Visting Queue (waiting list for registration)
==== Current Implementation

The patient visiting queue mechanism is facilitated by `UniquePatientVisitingQueue`, `AddPatientQueueCommand` and `RemovePatientQueueCommand`.
It supports adding and removing a patient from the visiting queue. `AddPatientQueueCommand` and `RemovePatientQueueCommand` inherit from `Command`.

The add patient into visiting queue mechanism functions like that of the `Add` but with patient name only. It searches for the patient to be added based on the patient name provided
by the user. If the patient already exist in the system then the patient will be added into the visiting queue. The `AddPatientQueueCommand` then calls for the utility method addPatientToQueue under `Model`, to update the visiting queue and trigger a IMDBChangedEvent to UI to update PatientListPanel.

Suppose that the user has just launched the application and login as medical staffs. The empty queue is shown in Figure 3.4.1.1 below.

image::emptyVisitQueue.png[width="400"]
Figure 3.4.1.1 The empty queue


The user now decides to add a patient into the queues.

`AddPatientQueueCommand` will search for the patient in the patient list. If the patient is found in the list, `AddPatientQueueCommand` will finally call the for the utility method addPatientToQueue under `Model`, to add the patient into the visit queue,
the updated queue is shown in Figure 3.4.1.2 below.

image::patientInQueue.png[width="400"]
Figure 3.4.1.2 The updated queue


The remove patient from visiting queue mechanism functions like that of the `Delete` but without any parameters. It removes the first patient of the queue. The `RemovePatientQueueCommand` then calls for the utility method removePatientFromQueue under `Model`, to update the visiting queue and trigger a IMDBChangedEvent to UI to update PatientListPanel.

Suppose that the queue contains patients as shown in Figure 3.4.1.3 below.

image::patientsInQueue.png[width="400"]
Figure 3.4.1.3 The queue contains some patients


The user now decides to remove the first patient from the queues.

`RemovePatientQueueCommand` will finally call the for the utility method removePatientFromQueue under `Model`, to remove the patient from the visit queue,
the updated queue is shown in Figure 3.4.1.4 below.

image::patientInQueueRemoveState.png[width="400"]
Figure 3.4.1.4 The queue after a patient is removed


==== Design Considerations

The following is an exploration of possible alternative implementations, the various aspects of
each implementation and the pros and cons of each implementation:

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the AddPatientQueue and RemovePatientQueue command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using LinkedList as queue to store patients
** Pros: Will be easy to implement due to existing utility methods.
** Cons: May have utility limitation.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a data structure class like linked list to store patient in a queue
** Pros: Can customise functionalities of the data structure.
** Cons: Will require time and more knowledge to do.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `AddPatientQueueCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Patient will only added at the back of the list
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: User cannot add patient in the position they want in the queue.
* **Alternative 2:** Patient can be added in any position in the queue
** Pros: Improve the functionality of AddPatientQueue command.
** Cons: Will require another implentation to add patient in the specified position in the queue.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `RemovePatientQueueCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Patient will only removed from the top of the list
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: User cannot remove a patient in a certain position.
* **Alternative 2:** Patient can be removed from the queue no matter which position the patient is in the queue
** Pros: Improve the functionality of RemovePatientQueue command.
** Cons: Will require another implentation to remove patient in the specified position from the queue.
// end::addqremoveq

// tag::login[]
=== Login System
==== Current Implementation
The action of logging into IMDB is facilitated by `LoginCommand` and the static class `LoginManager`, which also contains a static attribute of class `LoginState`.

`LoginCommand` takes in username and password input from the user, then calls the static class `LoginManager` to authenticate the given username and password, meaning that it will check through a csv file of correct usernames and passwords. If the given username and password are found in that file, then the value stored in `LoginState` will be changed to reflect the role of the user who logged in (doctor or medical staff).

If `LoginState` shows that no user is currently logged in, certain commands that access the database such as `AddCommand` and `ListCommand` will throw an exception telling the user to log in. Once logged in, the user can perform those commands.

There is no need for a logout command, since `ExitCommand` can be used to exit the application, and when the application is opened again, `LoginState` will be reset.

==== Design Considerations

The following is an exploration of possible alternative implementations, the various aspects of
each implementation and the pros and cons of each implementation:

===== Aspect: Implementation of `LoginState`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a static `LoginManager` class with a static `LoginState` attribute
** Pros: The methods of `LoginManager` can be called anywhere, and its stored `LoginState` attribute will not be changed except through the authenticate method.
** Cons: Need to implement as a final class with a private constructor, since Java does not support public static classes.
* **Alternative 2:** Store a login state in LoginCommand
** Pros: Can store login state as an int instead of an object instance.
** Cons: Will require a method in LoginCommand to update login state and verify username and password. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `LoginCommand` now needs to do two different things. Also, there is a need to somehow pass the login state to IMDBParser.
// end::login[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
