== PROJECT: IMDB - Integrated Medical DataBase

---

== Overview

Integrated Medical DataBase (IMDB) is a desktop health records application which is morphed from Address Book Level 4. The purpose of this project is to teach fellow CS2103T students about Software Engineering principles. This application is targeted to private clinics with multiple branches to better manage their records efficiently which also bring convenience to medical staffs and doctors. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added new command to allow medical staffs *add/remove patient into/from visiting queue during registration*
** What it does: allows the user to manage the order of consultations of patient effectively.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes if they do manual management of visiting queue.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
** Credits: none
