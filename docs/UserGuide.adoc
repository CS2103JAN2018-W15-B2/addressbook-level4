== Introduction

Integrated Medical DataBase (IMDB) is an application for the management of health records digitally.
Of note is the fact that IMDB is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
This makes it perfect for doctors or staff who can type faster than they can navigate with a mouse.
If you are a medical staff who can type fast, IMDB can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional pen and paper or even normal GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
