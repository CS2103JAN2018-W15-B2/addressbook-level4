== Introduction

Integrated Medical DataBase (IMDB) is an application for the management of health records digitally.
Of note is the fact that IMDB is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
This makes it perfect for doctors or staff who can type faster than they can navigate with a mouse.
If your clinic has medical staff who can type fast, IMDB can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional pen and paper or even normal GUI apps.
Head to <<Quick Start>> to get started.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `imdb.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for IMDB.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds as shown in the figure below.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Try out the commands below to get a feel of the app:

* *`login`*: Launches the login GUI. Enter "bob" for username and "password456" for password. This will log you into the IMDB as Bob. Note that some commands will not work unless you are logged in.
* *`list`* : lists all patients
* **`add`**`n/John Doe ic/S1234567A p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 dob/11/11/1991 b/B+` : adds a patient named `John Doe` to the IMDB.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
